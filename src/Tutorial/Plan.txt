I have the codemirror editor installed with npm.

I can use it's built-in Lezer parser to both parse an AST and get syntax highlighting:

    For parser: https://lezer.codemirror.net/examples/setup/
    For example of using parser in codemirror: https://codemirror.net/examples/lang-package/

Note: in javascript that is imported by purescript, you can import javascript libraries BUT
you CANT import other javascript files. See: https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/2343


It looks like to get an AST from the parser, you do
parser.parse(..).topNode, which gives you a https://lezer.codemirror.net/docs/ref/#common.SyntaxNode
